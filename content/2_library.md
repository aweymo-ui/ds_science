## Events

We host a variety of events at the library which may be helpful, such as the **Information Landscapes** annual series that is freely available for anyone to attend. Over the last two years, I've contributed to this series with workshops on [using geolocation tools and methods to identify archival images that lack location metadata](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/geolocation/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and a workshop/resource on [discovering copyright free media to enrich your presentations](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/source_cr_free/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and most relevant to this presentation today, [an introduction to the citation manager Zotero](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/zotero_intro/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Nearly all of our faculty creates workshops for this series and it covers a very diverse amount of material which is helpful for both undergraduate and graduate students.

We are also celebrating our 25th anniversary of **GIS Day** at the library, an event which brings together scholars, students, professionals, businesses, and the public to discuss geospatial technologies and demonstrate their many uses. I also created a presentation for this event on the different tools available now for creating [aerial time lapse videos](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/aerial_timelapse/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, something that could certainly help enrich scientific presentations.

We also curate a series in our **DataHub called [Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MdArvT5LVdxYSxDvWRuVDQqYmiLz_Qv){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**, which cover a range of technologically oriented material, ranging from creating your own static sites using GitHub, modelling data visualizations so they can be more easily understood by the public and creating text mining tools using Python to help understand vast amounts of text [before taking a closer look at each part of the text individually](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/distant_tech_talk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This year I will be giving [a tutorial on using Google Earth Studios](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/ges_geo_vis/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to create geographic visualizations that you can use to make your research more dynamic. 

We also just started hosting the long running **[Renfrew Colloquium](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/mric){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** at the library in the first floor "living room" area that has a big success so far and hosted a wide variety of really interesting speakers that have ranged from "Climate-Smart" Agriculture and Marketing, to composing music for silent film and the architectural value of Idaho's fire watch towers.

**Keep track of all of our events at the library on our [calendar](https://libcal.uidaho.edu/calendar/workshops?cid=4884&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=4884&inc=0)!**

## Physical Resources

<br>

**In addition to private study and conference rooms you are welcome to reserve for individual and group study**, the library also maintains unique technical resources to help enrich your work. This includes **[The Studio](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/studio/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**, where you can use audio/visual production equipment to record, edit and digitize audio and video projects. The Studio was recently updated summer 2025 with a new podcasting space for students to record longform interviews as well as a "Whisper Room" enclosure for recording dialogue in a sound designed space.A full list of resources can be found at this [link in the presentation site](https://vandalsuidaho-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hanwendong_uidaho_edu/EZe6R_SuDnZCm2xK7vepWwsBbKSxVMyrv34ANJF66OFxSw?e=VHFEqq){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

There is also the **[Making, Innovating and Learning Laboratory](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mill/)** (or the MILL) that has 3D printers, vinyl cutters, sewing machines, VR headsets and a laser cutter available for reservation and regularly hold really fun, interactive events that are a great way to meet people on campus. [On the calendar for this year](https://libcal.uidaho.edu/calendar/workshops?cid=4884&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=4884&ct=27543&inc=0) there are some great tutorials about using 3D pens, journal making, designed faux stained glass and an intro to coding.

We also maintain an extensive **[academic archive](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** at the U of I library that can be a valuable resource for primary documents to help make your work stronger and add historic contrast. You can search the archive at a collection (not item) level through this [Archives West portal](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/search.php?r=idu&q=){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and, if you find something of interest, contact our excellent archivists at libspec@uidaho.edu with the details, who can schedule you a time to review the materials in person at the first floor meeting room.

I have recently collaborated with Special Collections on two CALS-related, [Gary Strong Fellowship](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/strong-fellowship.html) recipient projects on the [Plant, Soil, and Entomological Sciences Records](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/pses/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [WWAMI Scrapbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/wwami/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} digital collections.

Which leads me to my corner of the library, the **CDIL**. Every year, we work with undergraduate, graduate and faculty recipients of the [CDIL and Berry Fellowships](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/fellowships/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and I would highly encourage you to apply this year if you are interested in building a site to help enrich your research and develop your technical skills!
