## About me:

<br>

My name is Andrew Weymouth and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning ](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}(CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, collaborating on projects with fellowship recipients, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department.
