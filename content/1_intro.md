My name is Andrew Weymouth and I am an [assistant professor with the University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) and [the digital initiatives librarian for the Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies department](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) where I develop digital tools and workflows to enhance transcription, tagging, and image processing to make the university’s media, text, and visual resources more discoverable for researchers.

<br>

**The goals for presentation are to:**

- Discuss the ways that digital scholarship can help enrich your scientific research
- Share examples of scientific research collaborations that my department has helped develop
- Think about new ways to present your work, and how those different perspectives can create new scholarly connections

I am also the CALS liaison for the Library, which means that I regularly talk with and present to science students on how they can find and explore library resources, including events, physical spaces, online catalogs, as well as special collections. [Visit my workshop](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/cals_intro/) for an overview of these resources, as well as some search strategies to make the process a little less daunting.

I also focus on using static web technology to curate the institution’s special collections and partner with faculty and students to create custom fellowship projects. Two examples of science oriented fellowship projects have included the, [Gary Strong Fellowship](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/strong-fellowship.html) recipients producing the [Plant, Soil, and Entomological Sciences Records](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/pses/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [WWAMI Scrapbook](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/wwami/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} digital collections.

Which leads me to my corner of the library, the CDIL or center for digital inquiry and learning, located on the second floor of the library building. Every year, we work with undergraduate, graduate and faculty recipients of the [CDIL Fellowships](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/fellowships/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and I would highly encourage you to apply this year if you are interested in building a site to help enrich your research and develop your technical skills!

## Digital Scholarship

<br>

To begin, _digital scholarship_ (somewhat interchangeable with “digital humanities”) refers to academic work that leverages digital tools, methods, and platforms to conduct research, present findings, and engage with both scholarly and public audiences. It encompasses the use of digital technologies to enhance traditional research practices and introduces new ways of creating, sharing, and analyzing knowledge.

As we will explore today, digital scholarship consists of selecting only certain parts of the data you have assembled and representing that data in different ways in order to draw out new insights and connections, help people understand new dimensions of your findings and also create accessible material online, so the greatest number of people can explore and learn more about your work. 

Hosting your research on a static site like GitHub also helps preserve your work, as a version controlled format, where all of the changes to your site are recorded, allowing you to go back to previous iterations if you ever need to. This act of publishing online also establishes authorship of your material and the visibility of publishing can help you find potential scholarly collaborators who are focusing on the same topics. 

Digital scholarship approaches aren't just for your potential audience, they can also help you understand your research in new ways too. Being in higher education and in a small area within a discipline will help make you a specialist, but it can also make you so familiar with your subject that you may no longer be able to see "the forest through the trees." By highlighting commonalities, reframing narratives to focus on certain sets of actors or findings, or increasing the scope of your data to look at everything in a single frame, you can also develop your own understandings of your work, or challenge preconceived notions of what you previously understood.

## CollectionBuilder

<br>

In the CDIL, we host [all of our collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and [digital exhibits](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) from a static web template developed in-house called [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/). This GitHub based approach allows us to have full control of updating materials and allows us to preserve and migrate our collections as we develop as a department. There are many different versions of CollectionBuilder now, some more intensive and some extremely lightweight and approachable for people who are new to site development, but they all function very similarly. 

CSV files, or spreadsheets, inform the individual items that make up a collection. These spreadsheets contain all of the relevant _metadata_, or data about those items, which can inform maps, word clouds and timelines, so researchers can understand your work from a variety of angles. Once this database of images, documents, video and audio is established, contextual material like About pages or essays within the collection can add more nuance to your findings. To make scholarly connections between the items in your research, sections like location, author names and subjects need to follow a _standardized language_, which allows potential researchers to drill down on these likenesses between items in visualizations or grouping through keyword searches. 

> CollectionBuilder, and all of the software needed to work with it, is completely free to use. Visit our [CollectionBuilder documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for a comprehensive guide and step-by-step walkthroughs for everything you need to create, maintain and update a site for your research.
