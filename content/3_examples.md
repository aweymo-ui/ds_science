**Here are a few examples of scientific work** that we have collaborated on in the CDIL to help you think about ways you can reconsider and reframe your own work.

The [Plant, Soil, and Entomological Sciences Records collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/pses/) was created by Gary Strong Fellowship recipient Kate Morrison "to highlight the entomological work of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Idaho between 1935-1966." The digital approach was created to "serve as important data banks for research into documenting species’ population and diversity, improving public health, enhancing agricultural practices, ensuring food security, and monitoring global changes."

[The Chestnut Collective](https://thecdil.github.io/chestnutcollective/) is another example of digital scholarship applied to multidisciplinary scientific research. Created bby Nick Koenig for a CDIL Graduate Fellowship, the project is a "sociocultural and sociopolitical research project tracking the blight and subsequent loss of the American Chestnut on Appalachian families and communities." This project implements Oral History as Data, another offshoot of CollectionBuilder, to enrich interview recordings with subject and tag data, which were various emotional descriptions. This visualization on the landing page allows visitors to the site to explore recordings by interviewee or these tagged emotions.
