**Here are a few examples of scientific work** that we have collaborated on in the CDIL to help you think about ways you can reconsider and reframe your own work.

The [Plant, Soil, and Entomological Sciences Records collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/pses/) was created by Gary Strong Fellowship recipient Kate Morrison "to highlight the entomological work of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Idaho between 1935-1966." The digital approach was created to "serve as important data banks for research into documenting species’ population and diversity, improving public health, enhancing agricultural practices, ensuring food security, and monitoring global changes."

[The Chestnut Collective](https://thecdil.github.io/chestnutcollective/) is another example of digital scholarship applied to multidisciplinary scientific research. Created bby Nick Koenig for a CDIL Graduate Fellowship, the project is a "sociocultural and sociopolitical research project tracking the blight and subsequent loss of the American Chestnut on Appalachian families and communities." 

This project implements [Oral History as Data](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/docs/), another offshoot of CollectionBuilder, to enrich interview recordings with subject and tag data, which were various emotional descriptions. Additionally, the visualization on the landing page is another customization which allows visitors to the site to explore recordings by interviewee or these tagged emotions. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="ds_science_02.jpg" alt="Bowl against a black background with blue cobalt illustrations of bats and a swan." caption="Item from the Historical Japanese Ceramic Comparative Collection, link below." width="100%" %}

The [Historical Japanese Ceramic Comparative Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/hjccc/) is an example of digital scholarship in historical archaeology by Ph.D. Candidate Renae Campbell as part of her 2018 CDIL Digital Scholarship Fellowship. This collection features multiple "child" items per page, allowing researchers to engage with the artifacts remotely but thoroughly. 

There is also quite a bit of customized metadata, allowing visitors in the archaeological field to make chemical connections around the type of materials, decoration method and the pigments that were applied to the objects. This work is also complimented by with a glossary with kanji translations and a helpful visualized directory, where readers can explore the collection by vessel type.

{% include gallery-figure.html img="ds_science_09.gif" alt="Screen capture of a trail cam documenting a caribou trotting through the woods with a map visible in the background." caption="Game cam video embedded in the map of the Storying Extinction digital exhibit" width="100%" %}

[Storying Extinction: Responding to the Loss of North Idaho’s Mountain Caribou](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/storying-extinction/about.html)  is a multidisciplinary digital humanities project which documents the human and animal history of North Idaho through oral history of residents who have had encounters with caribou and game camera footage. The project implements _deep maps_, multi-dimensional, interactive visualizations that offer an alternative to traditional representations of space. The site also allows readers many different _ways in_ to the material, exploring the material geographically, through transcribed oral histories, through multi-modal essays, as a database of items, or, my favorite, literally through the trails in the area, allowing readers to drop into the wilderness at various points.
